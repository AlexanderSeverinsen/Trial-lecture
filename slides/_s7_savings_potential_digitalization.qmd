IEA analysis on the role of digitalisation in
buildings finds that smart contols and connected devices
could save 230 EJ in cumulative energy savings to 2040,
lowering buildings energy consumption by as much as
10% globally, while improving thermal comfort and delivering greater amenity to building occupants (Figure 5)
