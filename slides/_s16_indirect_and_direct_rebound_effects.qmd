It is possible, however, that some indirect rebound effects are not merely a ‘price’ effect

Druckman et al. (2011) 

Does spending habits changed when they set out to reduce their CO2 emissions by 

- reducing indoor temperatures 
- not wasting food
- and travelling less by car. 


- average indirect rebound effect was 34 per cent
- one household’s was as high as 515 per cent. 

The unit of measurement was kilograms of CO2 emitted, rather than units of energy, but the principle is similar. 

Heating, eating and travel became cheaper, so a portion of the savings were redeployed into other CO2-emitting practices.

 Leonard Brookes, independetly of Khazoom, had similar ideas.
 
Both called the phenomenon ‘backfire’ 

In later papers, Khazzoom (1987; 1989) noted that this phenomenon had been observed in the nineteenth century by the English philosopher and economist William Stanley Jevons

Jevons, William Stanley, 1865/1965. The Coal Question: An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal-mines, 3rd edition 1905. New York: Augustus M. Kelley.

observed in the nineteenth century by the English philosopher and economist

 that the more efficiently Britain consumed coal, the more coal it consumed
 
It was in the midst of this debate that the terms ‘rebound’ and ‘rebound effect’ emerged. There is no certainty as to when precisely these terms began to be used. Lovins spoke of ‘rebound’ in this context in a brief paper in 1988 (Lovins, 1988), and the term ‘rebound effect’ was used in a conference discussion as early as 1983.
