- A lot of variation within the same study
- What about Norway?

*Direct rebound effect - micro effects/household level)*
Substitution effect 
Income effect 

In a study of heating energy use in Austria Haas and Biermayr (2000) 
cross-sectional and longitudinal statistical analysis, included intervention study looking at the change of energy use in apartment buildings with a building retrofit. They find a 30% rebound of heating energy in all cases.

Greening and colleagues (2000) present a comprehensive survey of studies in the United States, which indicates that the rebound effect is somewhere between 0% (for white goods) and 50% (for space cooling), but typically less than 30% (space heating, lighting, automotive transport).

Khazzoom (1986) on electrically heated homes in Sacramento, California in the USA shows a rebound effect of as high as 65%

Schipper and Grubb (2000) review studies covering 80–90% of energy use in OECD countries and find that the rebound is on the order of 5–15%
